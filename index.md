I am someone who loves to educate themselves to make noble use of their leisure. 
Doing so, leaves me with a lot of wonderful ideas. 
I constantly wonder why these ideas are not being implemented at a knowledge level or a systemic level. 
The purpose of this blog is to make my ideologies known to the world, in a serious / fun way depending of course, on my mood. :)

It is my innate desire to see my ideas implemented.
I urge and motivate readers to adapt the content for your implementation however you see fit without foregoing one's morality.  

Love - P.S.
